- Colors of Strength- Art Therapy website:

A responsive website created for my final project is my CIS300 class. It promotes the benefits of art therapy. The site emphasizes calm design, accessibility, and user engagement.

Purpose:

This project was built to demonstrate skills in HTML5, CSS3, and responsive design using media queries. It serves as both a portfolio piece and a practical resource in support of mental well-being through creative expression.

How to Use:

Visit the live site here: [GitHub Pages Link](https://Jaroble7.github.io/colors-of-strength)

You can navigate the homepage, learn about the program on the services page, and use the contact form to get in touch.

How to Run:

Clone or download the repository, then open `index.html` in your browser. No installation or server setup neededâ€”it's all static HTML and CSS.
