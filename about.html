  <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My journey through mental health has taught me that healing doesn’t always come in straight lines or quiet moments—it sometimes arrives through creation. In my darkest hours, creative expression became my refuge. Writing, music, and visual art didn’t erase the pain, but they gave it rhythm. They became the water after the storm—a calming, clarifying force that helped me reclaim parts of myself I thought were lost. Now, I carry that peace with purpose. I want to help others discover the stillness and strength that creativity can bring, guiding them to explore their own voices, to heal out loud, and to know they’re not alone. My mission is to cultivate spaces that honor both vulnerability and transformation—where expression becomes a bridge to recovery, and peace is something we find, not just alone, but together.

      <blockquote>“At first the dark parts scared me, but they became the most beautiful part!” – [Jessica Lee]</blockquote>
      <p>"It started with one session, "paint a circle and build the feelings of past present and future around it" when I was done I had a canvas full of colors that showed fear, courage, unknown and it was me. Now I come regularly and my mind has never known such peace."</p>

      <blockquote>“Art welcomes everyone” – [Jason Robles]</blockquote>
      <p>"I'm not really an artistic guy and I struggle with perfection. When I tried all other forms of therapy though, you start to get desperate. I'm so proud I didnt give up because then it would not have led me here. Its not about the image, its about the release."</p>
