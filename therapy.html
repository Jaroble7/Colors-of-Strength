    <h1>What is Art Therapy?</h1>
    <p>Art therapy is a therapeutic practice that uses artistic expression as a way to support emotional well-being and personal growth. Instead of relying solely on words, we explore feelings, thoughts, and experiences through creative activities like drawing, and painting.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of Art Therapy</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Emotional Expression and Release Art provides a safe outlet for expressing complex emotions that may be difficult to articulate. Through creative activities, we can process grief, anxiety, trauma, and stress in a supportive environment.</li>
      <li>Enhanced Self-Awareness Creating art can uncover thoughts and feelings beneath the surface, helping individuals gain insight into their behaviors, motivations, and inner conflicts. This self-discovery can foster personal growth and healing.</li>
      <li>Stress Reduction and Relaxation Engaging in art-making activates calming neural pathways, offering mental relief and physical relaxation. It encourages mindfulness, reduces tension, and supports overall well-being.</li>
